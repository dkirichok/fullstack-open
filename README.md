This repository contains my code and notes for the FullStackopen project offered by the University of Helsinki. FullStackopen is a free online course that teaches full-stack web development using React, Node.js, and other modern tools. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, the FullStackopen project is an excellent way to learn full-stack web development.

The project is divided into several parts, each focusing on a specific topic or concept. Each part includes several exercises and a final project to help you apply what you have learned.

In this repository, you will find my completed exercises and projects for each part of the FullStackopen course.
